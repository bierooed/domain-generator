# Break domain generator

Imagine that you are working on a program that will be used for the generation of schedules based on several constraints. Namely, you are trying to create schedules for the university classes, hence you need to place some breaks. But you need a way of identifying which breaks should be placed and that is why you decided to create a domain reduction algorithm that will return a list of possible breaks that can be placed.
